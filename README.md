Kraske's React Theme 2016
=========================

Let's make a WordPress theme using react for my site at kristoferraske.com!

The goals of this theme are:

* Use React to dynamically load the frontend using the WP REST API
* Full progressive enhancement. You shouldn't even need javascript to get your content
* Be able to load and tear down static assets. This is a weird requirement but
I want to be able to put the content from my old site on this one
